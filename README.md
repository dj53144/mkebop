   - Allows independent routing of audio channels for karaoke music, vocals, and effects.
   - Integration with UHC filters for audio clarity in noisy environments.

3. **Bluetooth Integration**:
   - Handles Bluetooth keyboard pairing and input management.
   - Configurable shortcuts for playback control, lyric scrolling, and system commands.

4. **Button and Joystick Control**:
   - Configured to work with the display HAT.
